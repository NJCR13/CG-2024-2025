# CG 2024/2025

A **3D interactive scene** developed for the Computer Graphics course (2024/2025), combining modeling, animation, and shaders. The project integrates multiple computer graphics techniques to create an interactive virtual world where a firefighting scenario comes to life.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to apply and extend knowledge of 3D graphics programming by building a **complex animated environment** with user interaction.  
Key elements of the scene include:  
- A **sky-sphere with moving panoramas** simulating the sky and horizon.  
- A **firefightersâ€™ building** with configurable floors, windows, textures, and a heliport.  
- A **forest** composed of parameterized, randomly varied trees.  
- A **lake** providing water resources.  
- An **animated helicopter** that can be controlled via keyboard to take off, land, fly, and carry a water bucket.  
- **Fire and extinguishing mechanics**, where the helicopter collects water from the lake and drops it to put out fires in the forest.  
- **Shaders and animations** to add realism (flame ripple effects, heliport lights, animated textures).  

## Features  
- Procedural modeling of objects (trees, buildings, helicopter).  
- Interactive controls for helicopter movement (`WASD` + custom keys).  
- Real-time animations: helicopter maneuvers, fire flames, water bucket, and heliport signals.  
- Use of **shaders** for dynamic effects (fire ripple, texture blending, lighting).  
- Randomized forest generation for varied environments.  
- Texturing applied across environment objects for realism.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** JavaScript (WebGL / CGF Framework provided by course)  
- **Techniques:** Shaders (GLSL), procedural modeling, textures, animation, lighting  
- **Environment:** Developed on base project provided via Moodle
